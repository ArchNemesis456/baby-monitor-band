# Baby Monitor Band System

This project implements a wearable baby monitoring system consisting of two hardware units:

## Baby Band
- Collects sensor data (movement, temperature, etc.)
- Sends alerts wirelessly to the parent band

## Parent Band
- Receives alerts from the baby band
- Notifies the parent in real-time

## Technology
- Microcontroller-based system
- Embedded C / Arduino
- Wireless communication

This project focuses on hardware-software integration and embedded system design.
